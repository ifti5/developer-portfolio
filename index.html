            <p>Patenga Sea Beach (পতেঙ্গা সমুদ্র সৈকত) is one of the most beautiful and popular beaches of Bangladesh.
                Located just 14 km away from Chittagong, it is easy to reach and the popularity of tourists is
                increasing
                day by day. In addition, there are also several plans that are being implemented to make the beach more
                attractive. Now to build a modern and world-class tourist center on the 5 km length Patenga beach is
                underway. The spectacular decoration has already
                caught the eyes of everyone.</p>

            <p>
                I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. My parents instilled that in me at a very young age.
                Our
                summers, and a lot of our weekends, were spent travelling in our RV. We did a lot of local trips here in
                ALBERTA but also went on some long haul journeys. We drove to ALASKA, across Canada, and to Southern
                California, just to name a few. I loved seeing new places and learning about the history and culture.
                Social
                Studies was always my favourite subject in school.
